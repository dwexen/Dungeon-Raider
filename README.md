# Dungeon-Raider

This is the nearly finished implementation of our final project "Dungeon Raider".

The idea is that a group of heroes is traversing a dungeon and getting loot. Stopping once they can no longer survive, 
and then ordering pizza. The pizza delivery man cannot fight, so he must traverse rooms that have been
cleared by the heroes.

The missing methods in this version are the methods that print the output of the result of heroes fighting in a room.

In the main file there are example test cases and code that will print to the terminal showing the output.
There are implementation of graph algorithms:
Depth-first search
Breadth-first search
Minimal Spanning Tree(Modified to be a "maximal spanning tree")
Dijkstra's algorithim
Floyd's algorithim


This was a fun project and will be completed soon!
